About
======
`Approach0`_ is a math-aware search engine.
"Math-aware" means you can add math expression(s) as some of
your keywords to have search engine help you find similar
expressions and return those documents that you may find
relevant to your input.
In short, a typical search engine plus math search.

Current State
===============
As for now, all basic functionalities are already implemented (see `features`) and
it is ready for using on large data. In fact, the current demo searches Mathematics StackExchange
and ArtOfProblemSolving containing over one million posts/topics and tens of millions of math formulas.
It has achieved pretty much real time with only four low-end VPS nodes, costing 20$ per month in total.

However, this project is still considered a `side project`, you
may not use it for production for many reasons.
