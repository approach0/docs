About
======
Approach0 is a math-aware search engine.
"Math-aware" means you can add math expression(s) as some of
your keywords to have search engine help you find similar
expressions and return those documents that you may find
relevant to your input.
In short, a typical search engine plus math search.

Current State
===============
As for now, all basic functionalities are already implemented (see `features`) and
it is ready for using on large data. In fact, it searches over 1 million posts on Math StackExchange in
pretty much real time with only two low-end servers hosting 3 search instances.

However, this project is still considered a `side project`, you
may not use it for production for many reasons.
