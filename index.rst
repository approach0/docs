About
======
Approach0 is a math-aware search engine.
"Math-aware" means you can add math expression(s) as some of
your keywords to have search engine help you find similar
expressions and return those documents that you may find
relevant to your input.
In short, a typical search engine plus math search.

Current Status
===============
This project is still being considered in prototype stage, however,
some novel and experimental models are being evaluated in research branch.
Recent direction is to apply the promising model to master branch and rewrite some modules (e.g., replace Indri with our own text-index) to make code more maintainable.

Next things to do is listed in our `project TODO lists <src/TODO.html>`_.
